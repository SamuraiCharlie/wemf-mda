# What
## wemf-mda
This is a tool to **generate code** using a model driven strategy.

## model driven architecture
"[Model Driven Architecture® (MDA®)](https://www.omg.org/mda/) is an approach to software design, development and implementation spearheaded by the OMG."

In other words, the basic idea is to build a UML model for your software, and then have a framework like [Andromda](http://andromda.sourceforge.net/) generate code for you.

# Why
## use mda
- Developers must deliver code fast
- Enterprise architecture must be standardized
- Technologies keep changing

## use wemf-mda
The most famous and standard framework from model driven architecture is [Andromda](http://andromda.sourceforge.net/). But it does have its shortcomings:
- Andromda is a bit hard to extend.
- The MDA standard is based on UML models, so you must model your software using a graphical tool, but regular software developers prefer to code than to model.
- Most free UML tools are not capable of simultaneous editing by multiple people.
- XML and XMI are file formats not so easy to keep and merge versions.
